6lowpan is a Working Group in I\+E\+TF which defines the use of I\+Pv6 on I\+E\+EE 802.\+15.\+4 links.  


6lowpan is a Working Group in I\+E\+TF which defines the use of I\+Pv6 on I\+E\+EE 802.\+15.\+4 links. 

Our implementation is based on R\+F\+C4944 {\itshape Transmission of I\+Pv6 Packets over I\+E\+EE 802.\+15.\+4 Networks}, draft-\/hui-\/6lowpan-\/interop-\/00 {\itshape Interoperability Test for 6\+Lo\+W\+P\+AN}, and draft-\/hui-\/6lowpan-\/hc-\/01 {\itshape Compression format for I\+Pv6 datagrams in 6lowpan Networks}.



\hypertarget{a00070_drafts}{}\subsubsection{Specifications implemented}\label{a00070_drafts}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
We currently only support 802.\+15.\+4 64-\/bit addresses.
\end{DoxyNote}
\hypertarget{a00070_rfc4944}{}\paragraph{R\+F\+C 4944}\label{a00070_rfc4944}
R\+F\+C4944 defines address configuration mechanisms based on 802.\+15.\+4 16-\/bit and 64-\/bit addresses, fragmentation of I\+Pv6 packets below IP layer, I\+Pv6 and U\+DP header compression, a mesh header to enable link-\/layer forwarding in a mesh under topology, and a broadcast header to enable broadcast in a mesh under topology.

We implement addressing, fragmentation, and header compression. We support the header compression scenarios defined in draft-\/hui-\/6lowpan-\/interop-\/00. This draft defines an interoperability scenario which was used between Arch\+Rock and Sensinode implementations.

We do not implement mesh under related features, as we target route over techniques.\hypertarget{a00070_hc01}{}\paragraph{draft-\/hui-\/6lowpan-\/hc-\/01}\label{a00070_hc01}
draft-\/hui-\/6lowpan-\/hc-\/01 defines a stateful header compression mechanism which should soon deprecate the stateless header compression mechanism defined in R\+F\+C4944. It is much more powerfull and flexible, in particular it allows compression of some multicast addresses and of all global unicast addresses.



\hypertarget{a00070_general}{}\subsubsection{Implementation overview}\label{a00070_general}
6lowpan does not run as a separate process. It is called by the M\+AC process when a 6lowpan packet is received, and by the tcpip process when an I\+Pv6 packet needs to be sent.

It is initialized from the M\+AC process, which calls sicslowpan\+\_\+init (giving as argument a pointer to the mac\+\_\+driver structure).

The main 6lowpan functions are implemented in the sicslowpan.\+h and sicslowpan.\+c files. They are used to format packets between the 802.\+15.\+4 and the I\+Pv6 layers.

6lowpan also creates a few I\+Pv6 and link-\/layer dependencies which are detailed in the next section.

\hypertarget{a00070_Addressing}{}\paragraph{Addressing}\label{a00070_Addressing}
{\bfseries Link-\/layer addresses}~\newline
 The format of a 802.\+15.\+4 address is defined in uip.\+h. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{comment}{/** \(\backslash\)brief 64 bit 802.15.4 address */}
\textcolor{keyword}{struct }uip\_802154\_shortaddr \{
  uint8\_t addr[2];
\};\textcolor{comment}{}
\textcolor{comment}{/** \(\backslash\)brief 16 bit 802.15.4 address */}
\textcolor{keyword}{struct }uip\_802154\_longaddr \{
  uint8\_t addr[8];
\};\textcolor{comment}{}
\textcolor{comment}{/** \(\backslash\)brief 802.15.4 address */}
\textcolor{keyword}{typedef} \textcolor{keyword}{struct }uip\_802154\_longaddr uip\_lladdr\_t;
\textcolor{preprocessor}{#define UIP\_802154\_SHORTADDR\_LEN 2}
\textcolor{preprocessor}{#define UIP\_802154\_LONGADDR\_LEN  8}
\textcolor{preprocessor}{#define UIP\_LLADDR\_LEN UIP\_802154\_LONGADDR\_LEN}
\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries Neighbor Discovery Link Layer Address options }~\newline
 The format of ND link-\/layer address options depends on the length of the link-\/layer addresses. 802.\+15.\+4 specificities regarding link-\/layer address options are implemented in uip-\/nd6.\+h. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{preprocessor}{#define UIP\_ND6\_OPT\_SHORT\_LLAO\_LEN     8}
\textcolor{preprocessor}{#define UIP\_ND6\_OPT\_LONG\_LLAO\_LEN      16}
\textcolor{preprocessor}{#define UIP\_ND6\_OPT\_LLAO\_LEN UIP\_ND6\_OPT\_LONG\_LLAO\_LEN }
\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries Address Autoconfiguration}~\newline
 The address autoconfiguration mechanism also depends on the format of the link-\/layer address. The dependency is reflected in the \#uip\+\_\+netif\+\_\+addr\+\_\+autoconf\+\_\+set function in \#uip-\/netif.\+c. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{preprocessor}{#if (UIP\_LLADDR\_LEN == 8)}
  memcpy(ipaddr->u8 + 8, lladdr, UIP\_LLADDR\_LEN);
  ipaddr->u8[8] ^= 0x02;  
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{a00070_io}{}\paragraph{Packet Input/\+Output}\label{a00070_io}
At initialization, the \#input function in sicslowpan.\+c is set as the function to be called by the M\+AC upon packet reception. The \#output function is set as the tcpip\+\_\+output function.~\newline
 At packet reception, the link-\/layer copies the 802.\+15.\+4 payload in the rime buffer, and sets its length. It also stores the source and destination link-\/layer addresses as two rime addresses. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
packetbuf\_copyfrom(&rx\_frame.payload, rx\_frame.payload\_length);
packetbuf\_set\_datalen(rx\_frame.payload\_length);
packetbuf\_set\_addr(PACKETBUF\_ADDR\_RECEIVER, (\textcolor{keyword}{const} rimeaddr\_t *)&rx\_frame.dest\_addr); 
packetbuf\_set\_addr(PACKETBUF\_ADDR\_SENDER, (\textcolor{keyword}{const} rimeaddr\_t *)&rx\_frame.src\_addr);
\end{DoxyCode}
 It then calls the sicslowpan \#input function. Similarly, when the I\+Pv6 layer has a packet to send over the radio, it puts the packet in uip\+\_\+buf, sets uip\+\_\+len and calls the sicslowpan \#output function.\hypertarget{a00070_frag}{}\paragraph{Fragmentation}\label{a00070_frag}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \#output function\+: When an IP packet, after header compression, is too big to fit in a 802.\+15.\+4 frame, it is fragmented in several packets which are sent successively over the radio. The packets are formatted as defined in R\+FC 4944. Only the first fragment contains the I\+P/\+U\+DP compressed or uncompressed header fields.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \#input function\+: This function takes care of fragment reassembly. We do not assume that the fragments are received in order. When reassembly of a packet is ongoing, we discard any non fragmented packet or fragment from another packet. Reassembly times out after \#\+S\+I\+C\+S\+L\+O\+W\+P\+A\+N\+\_\+\+R\+E\+A\+S\+S\+\_\+\+M\+A\+X\+A\+GE = 20s.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Fragmentation support is enabled by setting the \#\+S\+I\+C\+S\+L\+O\+W\+P\+A\+N\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+F\+\_\+\+F\+R\+AG compilation option.

As we do not support complex buffer allocation mechanism, for now we define a new 1280 bytes buffer (\#sicslowpan\+\_\+buf) to reassemble packets. At reception, once all the fragments are received, we copy the packet to \#uip\+\_\+buf, set \#uip\+\_\+len, and call \#tcpip\+\_\+input.

\#\+M\+A\+C\+\_\+\+M\+A\+X\+\_\+\+P\+A\+Y\+L\+O\+AD defines the maximum payload length in a 802.\+15.\+4 frame. For now it is constant and equal to 102 bytes (the 802.\+15.\+4 frame can be maximum 127 bytes long, and the header 25 bytes long).
\end{DoxyNote}
\hypertarget{a00070_hc}{}\paragraph{Header Compression}\label{a00070_hc}
{\bfseries Compression schemes}~\newline
 The \#\+S\+I\+C\+S\+L\+O\+W\+P\+A\+N\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+F\+\_\+\+C\+O\+M\+P\+R\+E\+S\+S\+I\+ON compilation option defines the compression scheme supported. We support H\+C1, H\+C01, and I\+Pv6 compression. H\+C1 and I\+Pv6 compression are defined in R\+F\+C4944, H\+C01 in draft-\/hui-\/6lowpan-\/hc. What we call I\+Pv6 compression means sending packets with no compression, and adding the I\+Pv6 dispatch before the I\+Pv6 header.~\newline
 If at compile time I\+Pv6 \char`\"{}compression\char`\"{} is chosen, packets sent will never be compressed, and compressed packets will not be processed at reception.~\newline
 If at compile time either H\+C1 or H\+C01 are chosen, we will try to compress all fields at sending, and will accept packets compressed with the chosen scheme, as well as uncompressed packets.~\newline
 Note that H\+C1 and H\+C01 supports are mutually exclusive. H\+C01 should soon deprecate H\+C1.

{\bfseries Compression related functions}~\newline
 When a packet is received, the \#input function is called. Fragmentation issues are handled, then we check the dispatch byte\+: if it is I\+Pv6, we treat the packet inline. If it is H\+C1 or H\+C01, the corresponding decompression function (\#uncompress\+\_\+hdr\+\_\+hc1 or \#uncompress\+\_\+hdr\+\_\+hc01) is called.~\newline
 When a packet needs to be sent, we try to compress it. If only the I\+Pv6 compression support is enabled, we just add the I\+Pv6 dispatch before the 802.\+15.\+4 payload. If H\+C1 or H\+C01 support is enabled, we call the corresponding compression function (\#compress\+\_\+hdr\+\_\+hc1 or \#compress\+\_\+hdr\+\_\+hc01) to compress the packet as much as possible.

{\bfseries H\+C1 comments}~\newline
 In H\+C1, if the I\+Pv6 flow label is not compressed, we would need to copy the fields after the flow label starting in the middle of a byte (the flow label is 20 bits long). To avoid this, we compress the packets only if all fields can be compressed. If we cannot, we use the I\+Pv6 dispatch and send all headers fields inline. This behavior is the one defined in draft-\/hui-\/6lowpan-\/interop-\/00.~\newline
 In the same way, if the packet is an U\+DP packet, we compress the U\+DP header only if all fields can be compressed.~\newline
 Note that H\+C1 can only compress unicast link local addresses. For this reason, we recommend using H\+C01.

{\bfseries H\+C01 comments}~\newline
 H\+C01 uses address contexts to enable compression of global unicast addresses. All nodes must share context (namely the global prefixes in use) to compress and uncompress such addresses successfully. The context number is defined by 2 bits. Context 00 is reserved for the link local context. Other contexts have to be distributed within the Lo\+W\+P\+AN dynamically, by means of ND extensions yet to be defined.~\newline
 Until then, if you want to test global address compression, you need to configure the global contexts manually.
